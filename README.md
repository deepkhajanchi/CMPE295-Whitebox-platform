# CMPE295: Model-Based AI Testing and Automation

## In this project, the authors propose a model-based white-box testing methodology to investigate the relationship between given machine learning models and their model test coverage and accuracy coverage. The proposed solution includes visualizing neural networks’ traverse inside each model, displaying linkages between nodes, and showing detailed information of each neural network layer. The test and accuracy coverage matrix also can be displayed to support users track, control, and enhance applications’ quality.
